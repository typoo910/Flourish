# Tooltips

Tooltips make compact or icon-only shell controls discoverable. `UseTips` sets the initial delay and enables Flourish tooltips in one step.

## Configure tooltips

```csharp
builder.ConfigureShell(shell => shell.UseTips(delay: 200));
```

## Timing and placement

The `delay` argument controls the initial hover delay in milliseconds. A shorter value shows help sooner; a longer value reduces unintended tooltips as the pointer moves across controls. It defaults to `200` and must be non-negative.

Flourish uses its built-in boundary margin to keep tooltips away from shell edges, including controls near the collapsed navigation panel, status bar, or toolbar boundary.

Omit `UseTips` when Flourish tooltips should remain disabled.

Background-task metadata tooltips are not controlled by `UseTips`. They are part of the [background-task](background-tasks.md) status surface and use their own initial delay. Hovering the waiting-queue icon opens an interactive flyout rather than a tooltip.
